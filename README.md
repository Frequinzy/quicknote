# Quicknote
An application made to allow for note-taking one click away. 

## How to use
The application was designed and tested for Linux with the Ubuntu distibution. But it should in theory still work on Windows and Mac based systems as they are compatible with Python's tkinter. 

On Ubuntu the program is set up by binding the "> python3 <some_path/quicknote/main.py>" command to a hotkey of your choice, my default being Super+n.
